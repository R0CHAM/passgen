# Password generator

This is a little program witten in python for generating random and secure passwords that uses the lib PySimpleGUI to create a graphic interface for the user.
When you click on "Gerar Senha" it creates an file .txt with the information filled by the user along with a "last updated at" time/date tag in order to keep track on possibles change in any password for the same user.

The program has a lot to improve and features that I want implement. I've began this project to learn the lib PySimpleGUI.
